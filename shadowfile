Sure! Here's a **brief and clear explanation of the `/etc/shadow` file** in Linux:

---

## 📄 What is `/etc/shadow`?

`/etc/shadow` is a **secure system file** in Linux that stores **hashed (encrypted) user passwords** and **password aging information**.

---

## 🔐 Why is it used?

To **protect password security** by keeping password hashes in a **root-only readable file**, separate from `/etc/passwd` (which is world-readable).

---

## 📍 File Location:

```
/etc/shadow
```

---

## 📦 File Format

Each line in `/etc/shadow` represents one user account, with **9 colon-separated fields**:

```
username:password:lastchg:min:max:warn:inactive:expire:reserved
```

## 🧩 Field-by-Field Explanation

| Field # | Name       | Description                                                                |
| ------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1       | `username` | Login name                                                                 |
| 2       | `password` | Hashed password (e.g. `$6$...`) or special value like `!` (locked account) |
| 3       | `lastchg`  | Days since Jan 1, 1970 that password was last changed                      |
| 4       | `min`      | Minimum days before user can change password again                         |
| 5       | `max`      | Maximum days before password must be changed                               |
| 6       | `warn`     | Days before expiry to start warning user                                   |
| 7       | `inactive` | Days after expiry before account is disabled                               |
| 8       | `expire`   | Account expiration date (in days since Jan 1, 1970)                        |
| 9       | `reserved` | Reserved for future use (usually empty)                                    |

## 🔐 Example Entry

```
vaibhav:$6$abc123...:19350:0:99999:7:::
```

* `vaibhav`: username
* `$6$abc123...`: SHA-512 hashed password
* `19350`: last changed on day 19350 (since Jan 1, 1970)
* `0`: can change password immediately
* `99999`: max 99999 days before password expires
* `7`: warn 7 days before expiry

---

## 🔒 File Permissions

```bash
ls -l /etc/shadow
```

Output:

```
-r-------- 1 root root  XXXX /etc/shadow
```

Only **root** can read it — this protects sensitive password hashes.
